# How to Download Thousands of Public Bacterial and Archeal Genomes

When it comes to download assembled genomes of targed species it can be very frustating going back and forward navigating trough NCBI assembly database.

The first problem is that not evertything that is deposited there is good, NCBI indeed has quality criteria of the genomes deposited (the criteria is xxxx) but it can be tricky to easly selected a genome set based on quality, genome source, and other metadata you might be intested on. Moreover, species names on NCBI are sometimes 


Learn how to select genomes of interest according to the bacterial or archaeal species, isolation source, or other criteria, and use the NCBI download tool to download them.
