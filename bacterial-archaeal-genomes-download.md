# How to Download Thousands of Public Bacterial and Archaeal Genomes

## ðŸš§ Problem
Downloading genomes can be very frustrating when navigating back and forth through the [NCBI Assembly Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/) website. 

## ðŸ’¡ What You Will Learn
- **Selecting Genomes**: Choose species as defined by the [Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB)](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/).
- **Filtering Criteria**: Filter based on quality, isolation source, or other relevant metadata.
- **Efficient Downloading**: Use the NCBI download tool to efficiently obtain the selected genomes.

## ðŸ’¾ Storage Requirements

Ensure you have sufficient storage space before downloading. Estimated storage requirements for compressed (`.gz`) genomes:

- **100 Genomes**: ~1â€¯GB
- **1,000 Genomes**: ~10â€¯GB
- **Whole GTDB r220 (~600K Genomes)**: ~6â€¯TB (*Requires access to an HPC*)

## ðŸ§¬ Why GTDB Labels?

The **Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB)** offers a standardized and up-to-date taxonomy. Here's why using it is beneficial:

- **Consistency**: GTDB provides a uniform naming convention, minimizing confusion from outdated/conflicting classifications.
- **Accuracy**: Regularly updated with the latest sequences, including draft genomes from metagenomes and isolates.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitates data comparison and integration across various studies.
- **Quality Control**: All genomes undergo quality checks using CheckM.
